IMC really encourages international collaboration and offers ditto opportunities. Shorter and longer term international assignments are very common practice.\r\n \r\nThe best thing I like about IMC is its culture and the people that form this: informal and collaborative, but very professional and ambitious. IMC puts a lot of effort in hiring people that share the same values and bring something unique. Another thing I like is that people are given as much responsibility as they can handle, and preferably a little more. There is a strong focus on learning and both personal and professional development.\r\n\r\nOverall, what has been keeping me here for nearly 6 years is the reward of working with a bunch of smart people on cool stuff in a fun and international environment.", "cons": "IMC is not for everyone though.

People are always willing to support wherever they can, but the ball is in your court.\r\n \r\nThe pace is high: you\u2019re expected to be always on top of your game, there is not much room for slacking around.

In my life, I've had the chance to work with (and in some cases, lead) groups of really smart people - Ph.Ds in math, computer science, physics from top schools, in a variety of fields. Among these, was my time at Vatic, which has assembled some of the brightest talent I've ever had the chance to work with. In addition to their raw talent, the team at Vatic is extremely down-to-earth and nice to be around. That shouldn't come as a surprise, since the group has developed and actively maintained some core company-wide values that stress camaraderie and respect. Working with this team, you'll learn a lot - from state-of-the-art machine learning, to high-performance computing, and when interacting with Jim (I did so on a daily basis), you will learn so much about the industry and the trade.  It's also a two-way street. Jim is enthusiastic to learn about machine learning and how to effectively apply it to trading.", "cons": "Nothing major here.
