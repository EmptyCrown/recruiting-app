IMC really encourages international collaboration and offers ditto opportunities. Shorter and longer term international assignments are very common practice.\r\n \r\nThe best thing I like about IMC is its culture and the people that form this: informal and collaborative, but very professional and ambitious. IMC puts a lot of effort in hiring people that share the same values and bring something unique. Another thing I like is that people are given as much responsibility as they can handle, and preferably a little more. There is a strong focus on learning and both personal and professional development.\r\n\r\nOverall, what has been keeping me here for nearly 6 years is the reward of working with a bunch of smart people on cool stuff in a fun and international environment.", "cons": "IMC is not for everyone though.

People are always willing to support wherever they can, but the ball is in your court.\r\n \r\nThe pace is high: you\u2019re expected to be always on top of your game, there is not much room for slacking around.

That shouldn't come as a surprise, since the group has developed and actively maintained some core company-wide values that stress camaraderie and respect. Working with this team, you'll learn a lot - from state-of-the-art machine learning, to high-performance computing, and when interacting with Jim (I did so on a daily basis), you will learn so much about the industry and the trade.
