But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. \r\n1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. \r\n2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. \r\n3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.", "cons": "1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the \"normal distribution\" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being \"average contributors\" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. \r\n\r\n2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent \"above average\" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated \"average contributor\" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.\r\n\r\nFrom talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. \r\n\r\n3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. \r\n\r\n4.

But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9+ years with the company. \r\n1. IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.).  Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact, and not by hours spent at their office. \r\n2. Great colleagues!  Though unfortunately, many have been leaving due to the instability of IBM's HW development business. \r\n3. At least in my area, there's a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact.", "cons": "1. Unfortunately, IBM still uses the \"normal distribution\" rating system, where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor (5%), above average contributor (15%), average contributor (~75%), and bottom contributor (5%).  This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world, where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours, and end up being \"average contributors\" at the end of the year, because there just isn't room for all to be top contributors. \r\n\r\n2. The above may not be so disturbing, if only IBM didn't practically cancelled all raises, performance bonuses and incentive for the non top-performers. I've had a consistent \"above average\" rating in the last 4-5 years, and my raise and performance bonus were ridiculous mere 1.5-2% of my salary.  Were I rated \"average contributor\" I would have gotten NOTHING. So you can imagine that people can go year after year without any raise to their salary.\r\n\r\nFrom talking to manager friend, this is IBM's way to eliminate the non-top-performers without having to fire them, as part of its direction of reducing US manpower. \r\n\r\n3. Hiring freeze in many areas - again, as part of IBM's attempt to reduce its workforce across North America and Europe we see many jobs move to the India and Far East markets.  This is of course upsetting to see local teams shrink and disappear, especially when many great local IBM colleagues and experts begin to drop out. From my experience thus far working with India SW teams - they are still very far away from the standards I would have expected from US and Europe based teams. \r\n\r\n4.

I was offered Starbucks stock after my first year, as well as 401k through Fidelity, and a superb Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance plan. You can cover your whole family with that plan, and it can include domestic partners. I got a pound of free coffee every week and free coffee all day (although I think that was specific to my store, which bent the rules). There's also an Employee Assistance Hotline which you can call if you're having issues in your personal life. And HR is really responsive--they won't see you as a troublemaker if you're legitimately having an issue. They will handle it.\r\n\r\nAlso, sexual orientation and gender identity are included in their anti-discrimination policy. None of the gay or lesbian people on my staff got crap for it, even though about half the staff was quietly conservative Christian and Republican.\r\n\r\nIf you're a people person, you develop relationships with the regulars and it's fun to make their day. I felt it was pretty rewarding to make drinks. I loved the artistic side of it. And again, the free coffee...just awesome. \r\n\r\nThey're also usually pretty flexible about scheduling, so it's ideal for if you're working two jobs or are a student. I worked with people in their 50's who had their own careers, but worked part-time at Starbucks for the health insurance. \r\n\r\nThe vacation time system is also pretty sweet. I worked with a guy who was there for 10 years and took like a month vacation to his home country.  \r\n\r\nThe staffs can be really tight...or they can be really vicious. But a spirit of teamwork is definitely encouraged. And exemplary work is recognized.\r\n\r\nIn an 8-hour shift you get three breaks: one 30-minute clock-out lunch, and two 10-minute on the clock breaks.\r\n\r\nYou'll also occasionally get those amazing customers and you live for seeing them. We had four customers who every year each put 100 bucks in our tip jar around Christmas. Sometimes those people can make your day with the things they say and do.", "cons": "If you work at a store worth their salt they will work you to the bone. Especially in a large or high-volume store there is so much to do, so much to clean. A morning shift person will have the absolutely insanity of a morning rush, but an evening person should be expected to handle evening rushes with a limited staff as WELL as get the place spotless in what I believe is not a reasonable time. We could get the place clean by 10:45, all right--if we broke the health and corporate rules about when to tear things down. And of course if that was ever found out we were in deep. And if we went over 10:45 we were also in trouble. Management sometimes has some very unrealistic ideas about what the job actually entails and what rules and boundaries should go with that.\r\n\r\nThe pay in my state starts near minimum wage. The ceiling for a barista is $10/hr, which you hit when you've been there about five years. But tips help, and some high-volume affluent stores will have tips up to $4/hr.\r\n\r\nThere's also a tendency to have fanatical management. Other \"kindly\" corporations like Whole Foods have this too--the managers drink the Kool-Aid and worship the company. I once spoke with my manager because my schedule was being changed with less than 24 hours notice, and that was against state law. She got this crazed look in her eye and spat \"Starbucks law goes above state law!\" But that's only a tendency. There are some pretty cool managers out there. Mine was insane.\r\n\r\nThe customers are spoiled rotten so they also get kind of unreasonable about their Starbucks. They will stand there and demand that you make a drink five times because there's still foam on that latte and they said NO foam, not LIGHT foam. This is a business model of Starbucks': everyone is special, and we will bend the rules for everybody. And I've had people scream at me and call me a (b) and promise me that they would make me lose my job. I've also had stuff thrown at me. But, that's also just customer service.\r\n\r\nThese last few years Starbucks has been obsessed with selling, too. There's a lot of pressure on the staff to make sure people go home with $15 bags of coffee and sub-par espresso machines. It's hard to maintain the relationships they want us to maintain while trying to sell stuff.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you can put up with the customers and the physical demand, and if benefits are more important than income, do it.

They set high standards, and consistently deliver. \r\nTheir project expectations and planning is excellent. The top level management folks are extremely smart and have a great sense of vision and planning. If you go to company social events (which are very frequent by the way), it is quite easy to have conversations with upper management people (Partners). \r\n\r\nDeloitte's hiring pattern is very consistent. For the young starters, they hire smart, well spoken, and subtly aggressive candidates. They have excellent training and knowledge management. They have a well oiled and empowered HR and Tech Support group. Things get done pretty fast. \r\n\r\nTheir paid time off program is really great, and pretty straight forward. No messing about.\r\n\r\nThey have a big social responsibility program that encourages volunteering. It also presents a great opportunity for youngsters to take event organizing responsibilities. This can be very very useful. Once, I volunteered for an event where we painted rooms for an orphanage center. There was a young guy who did the organizing. We were 10-12 people, with 3 senior executives actually doing paintwork. Quite unique. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have personally seen that Deloitte's top talents tend to start young, spend a 3-4 years, then take a hiatus to pursue a Graduate Degree (typically an MBA). The firm sometimes re-hires these consultants after their MBA with generous financial incentives. They offer much better packages to folks graduating from top universities. Sometimes they can offer huge joining bonuses. \r\n\r\nI worked in the IT consulting division.They tend to get top-end projects. On projects, the average age seems pretty low.  A lot of 20-somethings, then there are a handful of 30-40 year old people and some senior Management folks.\r\n\r\nBeginner salaries can be a bit low. (which is expected. It takes some time to build credibility in the Consulting business)\r\n\r\nOverall, a great place to start your professional career. If you pay attention, you will get seasoned very quickly.", "cons": "Work-life balance can become poor, especially during tight project timelines (This is expected in the Consulting Business). The employees have a significant amount of \"firm-internal\" training and knowledge contribution tasks. There are annual goal expectations. It can get tedious if you continuously work on high demand projects.\r\n\r\nThere is intense competition, especially during targeted promotion/milestone years. There can be some backstabbing. It's part of the experience. It is not as bad as it sounds, and seems manageable. \r\n\r\nA lot of times, being young and inexperienced has it's flaws. The company has a simple way of seasoning consultants. They get pushed into high pressure situations, and they learn fast, and quickly start managing their own work. But they tend to be blind towards intricate details, especially in complicated IT product implementations. This has an interesting effect. If someone is able to do the hands-on work, everyone else tries to piggy-back on that person for their actual work. The hands-on guy gets overwhelmed, and others try to use him/her as a key resource. \r\n-- I personally went through a crunch project, and found a number of people \"managing expectations\" (piggy backing), while a handful of people actually knew the end-to-end solution and did the hands-on work. \r\nThis created a lot more work and mental anguish than needed. Because of the expressed pressure, the hands-on guys have a hard time building and growing their reputation and subsequent performance evaluation rating. This also affects the project execution timelines.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you thoroughly read through your employment agreement and understand the implications. In recent years, they have started hiring for specific projects ONLY. This falls under a particular \"AMS service line\". In this case, if your assigned project gets into a problem, you are exposed to the risk of employment termination. \r\nTheir HR and Management are very helpful, and they will try to get you a new project. But there are several constraints like location, your skills, and limited time. I went through this, and it was somewhat unnerving.

It is a great culture that values collaboration (below the partner level), that truly values diversity of its employees, and that is very collegial.  The Advisory business has grown significantly over the past 5 years since reconstituting a consulting arm with the acquisition of BearingPoint, followed by other large acquisitions of PRTM, Diamond and most recently Booz & Company (Strategy& - which is, actually, a dumb name for a company that garners eye rolls and open chuckling among the staff).  The firm has also made smaller tuck in acquisitions as well to fill in small, but important strategic capabilities such as Ants Eye View (for social marketing, social media strategy, and social listening), and BGT (for digital marketing agency work).\r\n\r\nIt is a place where you can build a great career if you can deliver great work, excel at networking across the firm, and can build partner support.  Exceptional employees are the \"average\" here, so if you aren't knocking it out of the park all the time then you can expect to only be rated in the middle of the pack, and receive nominal raises and performance bonuses.  \r\n\r\nIt has a strong brand in the market.  The firm's latest brand health index rated it at the top of the other \"big 4\" firms (Deloitte, KPMG, and EY) as well as other non-audit/tax firms like Accenture.  The Strategy& acquisition added significant strategy consulting capability to position PwC to compete with the likes of BCG, Bain & McKenzie (who have little to no post strategy execution capabilities...meaning they are good at telling you what to do, but aren't really able to stick around to help you do it).  \r\n\r\nBob Moritz (Senior Partner) and Miles Everson (Advisory Leader) are great leaders who do a good job at inspiring staff to provide great, differentiating client service.  They are personable, approachable, and genuine (if they are not, then they deserve an Oscar for their performances - oh, wait, we audit the Oscars...maybe a Tony then).  They have a strong vision for how we will shift the firm to a global operating model over the next few years (today, we are a collection of member firms with each territory representing its own firm structure) which will enable us to better serve our clients, most of which operate globally today.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it is a place that I am proud to work at.", "cons": "As noted by many, and as inferred by by comment around individual performance above, if you want to get ahead here you WILL work your rears off.  Late nights and weekends, with minimal complaining, are the norm for those who are successful.  The firm has tried to add in concepts of \"flexibility\" into our work force - but that is generally ignored in practice by those people actually delivering client work (great thought, poor execution).  \r\n\r\nI know that many complain about what they see as the professional equivalent of \"sweat shop rates\" when it comes to compensation - but I honestly think that is over blown.  Sure everyone would love to make more money, but you can make 6 figures as a Senior Associate and almost $300K as a Director PLUS bonus...so, to me, the pay issue falls on deaf ears.  The one area that I think we could really improve on is in the area of our 401K matching percentage which is currently $0.25 on the dollar up to 6% of your contribution.  Many of our industry clients match dollar for dollar, so quarter for dollar is a bit of a slap in the face.  \r\n\r\nThe technology that we use as practioners, for the most part, is terrible with the exception of some of our new web enabled tools for pricing engagements and managing engagement economics.  For the last few years there have been many hints and encouragements that we would be replacing the much hated Lotus Notes (that's right boys and girls, we are still using the best of 1990s technology for email and calendaring).  There was a great deal of excitement and buzz in the firm - until we were told that we would not be moving to the standard...Microsoft Outlook.  Instead - we are \"Going Google\".  So, not only are we replacing one terrible system with another, we are not actually getting rid of Lotus Notes at all because 1) the Federal practice can't use gMail (the Feds won't certify the security of gMail's cloud) 2) certain accounts (like Microsoft) won't allow the use of Google products (Microsoft was so angry that they lost the replacement of Lotus Notes that we almost completely lost the account), and 3) the rest of the global firm won't be switching.  So we will be having to manage two separate email accounts and will be forced to use the terrible Google Docs over what everyone else in the world uses and likes - Microsoft Office.  Why did we select Google, one might ask.  The answer varies based on who you ask.  Some say it is because Google's cloud based tools will allow us to work in ways that we can't today for collaborating on the creation of documents and through Google's \"Hang Outs\"...this is ridiculous because Google's user experience is horrible (else, Microsoft would be losing market share to them in spades), and Microsoft already has the standard for collaboration through Link and Jive.  Some say it is because Google's cloud based services provide a lower total ownership cost - which is also ridiculous because Microsoft has Office 365 available through the cloud with Azure.  Some say it is because our technology isn't cool which is impacting our ability to attract talent on campus - which is the most ridiculous reason of all because who really joins a company because they can have a gMail account?  Also, I'm honestly not sure how we will be expected to use these fabulous tools in an offline capacity when we don't have internet connectivity (such as on a plane that is not equipped with WiFi).\r\n\r\nThe firm is also replacing its current performance management system (and process for handing out annual performance ratings and subsequent merit increases and performance bonuses) with a new system called the PwC Professional.  Basically, they are replacing a tried and true system of documenting written performance feedback (which is good for not only developing people but also for serving as a record of what people don't do well in the event an adverse action needs to be taken against an employee) with a mobile app that captures a rating against five dimensions and which replaces written feedback with oral feedback that has no memory and no record.  The \"coach\" who used to be responsible for representing their \"coachees\" at the Annual Review Committee time now has almost no role in the performance outcome of their staff displaced by the \"relationship partner\" who has responsibility now to personally know each and every staff member that they represent so that they can represent them to the other partner only \"performance roundtable\" discussions.  Partners today have very little time for junior staff, let alone demonstrated interest in their individual careers.  So now, a process that was cumbersome but was overly fair (you could only talk about things during ARC time that were documented - if it wasn't documented it was if it never happened and you had at least one person who knew you and advocated for you in the room when your performance was being discussed in the form of your Coach) and very transparent is being replaced with the equivalent of a papal conclave supported by a popularity contest.  Additionally, this mobile app (Performance Snapshots), only requires commentary if a staff member is not meeting expectations or is partially meeting expectations...so if you are meeting expectations you can't even comment on performance unless you are highlighting a performance differentiator that they only expect less than 50% of staff to have.  Lazy reviewers are incentivized through the design of the app to give everyone a meets expectations on all five dimensions and move on.  Our attrition rate has been very low for a professional services firm - it will be interesting to see what happens to attrition after the next round of annual reviews using the new PwC Professional.", "overall": 4, "overallNumeric": 4}, "ceo": {"name": "Robert E.

Sometimes you win; sometimes you lose. But nowadays losing carries a terminal prognosis.\r\n\r\nAll the above is flavored by a new positive discrimination towards underrepresented minorities (URMs) which by executive decree have preference for promotion, transfers, and in some measure the ranking benefits. Non-URMs have an additional hurdle of proving their unique ability to fit a role; URMs can fit anywhere and do not cost a department headcount budget for a period of time. Net-net is that if you are not a URM then hiring, transfer, and benefit opportunities narrow quickly.

Keep that in mind when reading.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've been here only 6 months, but I think I have enough of a feel for Optum to write a review.\r\n\r\nThe positives:\r\nGreat work/life balance: I never have to stay late, work on weekends, etc. I get 23 vacation days and my manager encourages me to use them AND completely unplug while away. \r\n\r\nBeautiful office: I work at the new Optum office in Eden Prairie. Building is modern and comfortable. Full size gym and locker room, and workout classes. Great parking ramp with a skyway so you never need to go outside in the rain or snow!\r\n\r\nWork from home: VERY progressive with WFH! I can work from wherever I want. if I want to WFH one day, I can. If I want to WFH the whole week, I can do that, too. No one questions you.\r\n\r\nTotal autonomy\r\n\r\nNo drama: This is a very heads down place! I can't stress that enough. No one socializes with each other -- most of the time, you never even talk to your cube neighbors (because they're probably working from home). This is a positive for me though -- after working in some high drama offices, this is a refreshing change. \r\n\r\nAll meetings are over webex: Great news if you hate in-person meetings like I do -- because there are very few! In the 6 months I've been here, I've had 4 in person meetings. This is also a con because you never meet your coworkers - read the con list for more info. \r\n\r\n30 minute \"best practice\" meeting times: You will not get invited to 2+ hour meetings, ever. Nearly all meetings are only 30 minutes. You might have the one-off meeting that's an hour, but it's rare. \r\n\r\nGood, standardized PM practices. But some of the documentation requirements are too rigid and can slow progress down. Our group is trying to move to 100% agile. Slowly.... All of my projects so far have been waterfall SDLC. Although as a new person, it would help to have a PM to shadow on some of these documentation/audit practices. I've had to learn as I go. \r\n\r\n- Great cafeteria with cheap prices. I can get a lunch here cheaper than I can bring it from home.\r\n\r\n-Very engaging training classes!!! All training classes are over LearnSource (i.e. your computer) but the videos are well done and entertaining.", "cons": "-Building seems empty because so many people WFH. It's almost kind of...sad. Such a nice building but no one is there.\r\n\r\n-Internet explorer is the browser of choice. Yuck. You have to have special permissions to download Google Chrome or Firefox on your computer.\r\n\r\n-If you like socializing with your coworkers, this is NOT a place for you! I can't stress that enough!! You will NOT meet your new BFF here. Everyone is very heads-down and focused on work -- no one chit chats about football or True Detective! You will not have coworkers stopping by your desk (to chat about a TV show OR to even chat about work). Most of my days, I don't talk to anyone in person. It's kind of depressing -- and I'm an introvert! There are no happy hours, social events outside of work, etc (this is a positive for me because I hate that stuff).\r\n\r\n-Lots of contractors. Not that it's a bad thing - I've had great experiences with the PM contractors. They obviously don't last as long as the employees, and there's more contractor PMs than employee PMs.\r\n\r\n-Difficult, as a new person, to know \"who's who.\" There is no face-to-face meetings, so as a PM, it's tough to know who does what, since there's no face to put with the name. I struggle with this a lot, as I'm not used to this extreme of a \"remote\" workforce! \r\n\r\n-No wifi for your phone. Wifi is only available for visitors and you must have a user name and password. \r\n\r\n-Nearly all social media websites are blocked. Not really a con, but something you might want to know. You won't be browsing facebook at work!\r\n\r\n-LOTS of meetings. Sure, the meetings aren't in person, they're over Webex, but you will have a LOT of them.\r\n\r\n-Some \"know-it-all\" ego-driven coworkers, especially on the tech side.

It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).\r\n* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.\r\n* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.\r\n* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.\r\n* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).\r\n* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.\r\n* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.\r\n\r\nNeither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.\r\n* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.\r\n* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance \"even at Google\" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.", "cons": "* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).\r\n* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.\r\n* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.", "overall": 5, "overallNumeric": 5}, "ceo": {"name": "Sundar Pichai", "title": "CEO", "numberOfRatings": 1789, "pctApprove": 96, "pctDisapprove": 4, "image": {"src": "https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/9079/google-sundar-pichai.png", "height": 200, "width": 200}}}, {"id": 3032, "name": "US Postal Service", "website": "www.usps.com", "isEEP": false, "exactMatch": false, "industry": "", "numberOfRatings": 4995, "squareLogo": "https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/3032/us-postal-service-squarelogo.png", "overallRating": "3.0", "ratingDescription": "OK", "cultureAndValuesRating": "2.5", "seniorLeadershipRating": "2.2", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": "3.5", "careerOpportunitiesRating": "3.0", "workLifeBalanceRating": "2.3", "recommendToFriendRating": 46, "featuredReview": {"attributionURL": "http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-US-Postal-Service-RVW4417180.htm", "id": 4417180, "currentJob": true, "reviewDateTime": "2014-06-16 19:00:17.137", "jobTitle": "CCA", "location": "", "jobTitleFromDb": "CCA", "headline": "Potential CCA's READ THIS REVIEW", "pros": "First: In this economy? The pay. New carriers start out at $15,30/hr and (even though your orientation leader may so you're not guaranteed 40 hrs/week) you will get a monstrous amount of overtime. Once you're past your first couple of months and you understand how to carry mail properly you will often work from 8a-6p nearly every day. Also with a few cities, like mine, you will work on Sundays for Amazon. This usually adds an additional 5 hours to the paycheck. Myself and other CCA's in the station work between 51-64 hours a week.\r\n\r\nSecondly: You are your own boss for the most part. You will spend 1-2 hours a day in the office between receiving and casing your magazines and any left over letters that the machine didn't sort out. Once you've been in past the 90 day probationary period you are eligible to \"hold down\" an open route. If you are lucky enough to get a good long term hold (the regular is gone for injury or some other reason) you will learn how to case routes very quickly. \r\n\r\nThird: Fitness. There's a lot of people who want to lose weight out there. I weighed 235 lbs when I first started working for the post office and now I weight 180. I lost 50 lbs in the first 3 months alone. It's all exercise though. You can diet if you want, but remember you'll need energy to walk those long routes.\r\n\r\nFourth: Coworkers. Yea, there are turds in every environment, but most of the career employees there are really pulling for you to succeed. Most carriers in my station are former military and a lot of them have been friends for decades. Being a CCA myself, I was worried about how well I'd fit in with some of the grizzled older carriers but they accepted me right away.", "cons": "So where to begin. Well remember when I talked about working all that overtime in the Pros section? It's not optional. You will be expected to be at work every day of the week, including Sundays, unless you have a decent management staff. During the Christmas season I once worked for 53 days straight without an off day. We had new CCA's get hired and quit within weeks. Have a family? Tough luck. You will get to see them from 6:30pm till they go to sleep. Sundays you will likely get off work around 1-2pm. \r\n\r\nManagement is mostly compromised of people who are former carriers or clerks, which is nice because they promote from withing, but the devastating caveat to this is that most of them are uneducated persons. A fair amount of carriers start when they're in their late teens and early twenties and come from jobs that were minimum wage or did not require them to have any kind of leadership training. The managers don't care about the welfare of the employees mental status until it's too late, and most of them tend to act like they were never carriers at all by expecting completely ridiculous things from the CCA's and some career carriers. It's not unusual for a carrier to be given a 2 hr \"assist\" in addition to whatever their main route is. While most carriers can get this done without much issue, for a new carrier or even an experience carrier on a bad weather day, it can become very stressful mentally.\r\n\r\nThe threat of being fired is incredibly annoying as a CCA. If you call off sick, if you need to have a personal day, if you even need to pick your kids up from school because your wife got stuck late at the office, a manager will pull you aside and remind you of how expendable you are. The Paid Time Off (PTO) you accrue will come very quickly, and you'll soon realize you have 40 hours and would like a nice little vacation.. too bad you can't take it. As a CCA you're expected to work 360 days a year and then you get 5 days off as a reward and a massive paycheck AFTER your 5 days off. Now you can use that fat cash to...uhhh.. buy something I guess? Certainly would have been more useful if I got it before the 5 day period to use on my vacation.\r\n\r\nWhile the career carriers are really great to deal with usually, the fellow CCA's can become very competitive. Often times if you're given an assist and it's better than another CCA's assist who has \"seniority\" over  you they will complain to other carriers and management that they should have gotten the \"good\" assist. This is one of the fatal flaws that new people with struggle with. No matter how much faster you are, no matter how much more accurate you are, no matter what, everyone gets promoted by time with the post office. This leads to a lot of carriers just doing the bare minimum and putting the excess on other CCA's or carriers. \r\n\r\nThe final con (that I'll write about) is that the weather sucks. I know carriers who have been delivering mail for 20+ years and they still can't deal with the rain, the snow, or the heat. The heat is the biggest killer for carriers by far though. If you're in an area that suffers from hot, muggy summers, get ready to consume gallons of water every day, and sweat that out (often onto your customers mail). The worst is when it rains on a hot summer day and then evaporates right off your clothing. Makes you feel like a walking sauna.", "overall": 4, "overallNumeric": 4}, "ceo": {"name": "Megan J.

I went through multiple interviews and received an offer within days of my final interview. Other companies I've had to sometimes wait months just for a rejection notice. ADP\u2019s hiring speed and process is fantastic, and I felt very important to them as a potential future employee.\r\n\r\n- Associates in my department are friendly, and the atmosphere with management is great too. They have an open-door policy so I don't feel nervous asking questions to my manager, let alone my manager's manager. Many of them also make an effort to wish everyone in the department \u201cGood morning\u201d in person. Overall, the company gives off a family vibe and less of a hierarchical one, which I appreciate.\r\n\r\n- Adding to my previous point, the company promotes an environment of inclusion and diversity. There are multiple support groups including for LGBT, veterans, women's inclusion, etc. It's great to see groups like these in place, and it gives associates the notion that they don't have to leave parts of their personal self at home.\r\n\r\n- The Elk Grove building has multiple amenities: Cafeteria, Fitness Center, and Wellness Center. Cafeteria food is pretty good, and the company ADP works with has a selection of quality options. You can use the Wellness Center to complete your biometric screening, flu shots, and daily medical concerns.\r\n\r\n- Benefits, 401k, Stock Purchase Plan available for employees depending on part or full time employment. Enrollment is easy and simple thanks to the website's newly designed layouts.\r\n\r\n- Surveys. ADP encourages not just their clients but also their employees to take them, ranging from company changes to training  to manager reviews. I think it's important when a company wants to hear from its employees so often.\r\n\r\n- Department has recently implemented a new Client Service model where employees are assigned to clients as a point-of-contact within ADP. I believe long-term this will increase client engagement and service over employees answering phone calls from random clients.", "cons": "- Department is busy and at times stressful. It's hard having a desire to participate in other ADP opportunities (social media, support groups, networking events) when workloads are overwhelming. There are multiples times I feel deterred from participating because I have so much client work or I'm mentally exhausted.\r\n\r\n- Knowledge training is long, boring, and ultimately ineffective. Out of my 14 weeks of initial training, I got 3 or 4 weeks worth, and it was mostly from shadowing other employees. It's not to say the training isn't informative, but it's mostly lectures, tests, and webcasts, and it's very difficult staying engaged for hours at a time.\r\n\r\nAs a result of similar feedback from other employees, training is starting to be condensed, but it proves to be even more ineffective. For example, what was once 6 weeks of knowledge training is now squeezed into 2 weeks. Instead of lectures and hands-on learning, 3/4 of it is now watching webcasts. Add to that most of the material presented was not even on the final test. If you compare this training to the yearly corporate policy training (which is exceptionally well-made, engaging, and fun), this feels rushed, lazy, and uncaring.\r\n\r\n- Company changes and implementations take a while. While ADP has been promoting quality over metrics for months, some current work models still do not follow the same idea. For example, job compensation is still rewarded more on job knowledge over performance.\r\n\r\n- Blackout dates are mid-November through January because they are the busiest times for clients to call in. Again, not a big issue for me because I understand the reasons why, but it can still be a bummer when overtime is considered a necessity during the holiday season.\r\n\r\n- Only 1 day of volunteer paid time off. I love to know I am making a difference, not just processing someone's payroll but also on a personal level. They are many opportunities offered, but due to only 1 day I feel I have to carefully choose which ones I will use it on.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile there is progress and transitions being made at ADP, there is plenty of room to continue improving its corporate environment.", "overall": 4, "overallNumeric": 4}, "ceo": {"name": "Carlos A.

The company does a great job of finding employees other work when projects close out.\r\nOverall very friendly co-workers and some brilliant minds\r\nOne of the most demographically diverse environments I've ever worked, especially considering the engineering industry\r\nManagement is experienced and usually keeps the employee insulated from managerial nuisances\r\nThey will pay for your education with generous applications of \"the rules\" in your favor. I have never taken advantage myself, but I've heard so many great things about the \"EdAssist\" program I have to mention it.", "cons": "Fairly average pay and benefits, nothing special. 401k match maxes out at 7% for new employees, if you contribute 8%.\r\nBonuses are only for top performers, based on your management performance review. They limit the recipients to ~10% at each level, so if you're new and below level 4 - good luck. Even if you get one, the amount is so small you don't even care to try the next year. I've seen about 3% of my gross salary one year when I was awarded the \"top\" level of review. Don't expect anything beyond your base salary.\r\nAbsolutely no company-sponsored extras, i.e. no work-related parties, no freebies, no perks, not even break rooms or TVs in their so-called flagship campus \"Space Park\" in Redondo Beach. This campus is a historical wonder, but a modern-day joke for such a large company to still be working in.\r\nEnormous corporation (80,000+ employees) means you cannot even begin to understand the high-level management structure. You will see congratulatory emails about VIP-level promotions for people you have not only never heard of, but couldn't even figure out their role if you tried.\r\nAlmost all of NG's business is from government contracts, most of which are defense related and a large portion of those classified SCI (the biggest exception is probably James Webb Space Telescope) This means lots of overhead, red-tape and process bloat. Be prepared for a one-line software code change to take 6 months and cost $1 million. SIGH.\r\nBusiness travel can be frequent, depending on your project. The business travel rules are nuts and an absolute nightmare to work though since you have to adhere to the government FAR regulations. Booking a short domestic trip can be way more trouble than necessary, especially when submitting expenses on the return.", "overall": 4, "overallNumeric": 4}, "ceo": {"name": "Wesley G.

You get a 40% discount on the food on the days you work, and Wendy's food is very good, especially in comparison to other fast food places, in my opinion. The menu doesn't say the same for more than 2 or 3 months. There are always limited-time offers that are good to try. Throughout the workday you can get soda from the soda machine.

While managers will try to work with you, there is only so much flexibility that they have. Wendy's is open until 1 in the morning and so the last shift ends at 2. It's possible to be scheduled as closing and then have to get up and work at 11 in the morning. The limited time offer items, although they can be delicious, become very stressful. Every new limited time offer means that you will have to learn how to make it quickly then forget about it and learn something else constantly, every two-three months . Upper management doesn't know what they want so you will constantly get in trouble for the same issue.

However, the company itself, other job functions, and the long-term outlooks aren't as standout.\r\n \r\n- Amazing Corporate Management Trainee / Sales Trainee / Ops Trainee programs, where you basically get paid to learn a lot, own millions / billions of dollars of real impact, and fast track your career growth. No where else do you get the same level of responsibility, and real exposure and relationships with senior management and even the C-suite, as a fresh-out-of-college kid. \r\n\r\n- Job flexibility & career growth - adding to the above, there is VERY rapid vertical and horizontal opportunities for you within the company. Due to the company culture (young, lean, meritocratic) and to the rotational component of the Corporate Trainee program, you get exposure to almost every part of the business, and work in two completely different job functions, within the first 6 months alone. Movement between Finance and Marketing especially is quite common. Finally, most trainees see movement every ~3-9 months, and most of the time that movement is a promotion. This velocity of movement is unmatched at any firm of competing size & prestige, and feels more like a startup. However, unlike a startup, you get the resources and good name of a big company to back your risk-taking, learning, growth, and ownership.\r\n\r\n- Open access to amazing people - each individual is driven and ambitious - we've all bought into this culture of quantified meritocracy. But collectively, the people at KHC are eager to help each other out, especially thanks to the open office culture (no cubicles! no specified hours! free reign & flexibility with where & how you spend your office time) and the constant movement of people to new functions and teams. Somehow, KHC manages to be the best of both worlds - provides a very collaborative and supportive community of peers, while also rewarding extreme individual ambition. \r\n\r\n- ZBB - exposure to ZBB looks great on your business resume, and it is an important efficiency mindset to apply to any business and to your life.\r\n\r\n- Ownership and meritocracy. Your career growth here is (mostly) up to you*", "cons": "- Job flexibility also means job insecurity -- those who get the most out of KHC and move up the fastest are willing and eager to take every opportunity, but that often means common job & team changes, which isn't for everyone. Layoffs and pressure to perform can also be stressful. \r\n\r\n- Poor work-life balance for finance functions\r\n\r\n- ZBB takes a toll on company morale - it's great that we save money from going to waste and see it pay out as higher bonuses, but paying for plastic forks during lunch and not having many company bonding events really sucks\r\n\r\n- Minority representation in the company as a whole, but especially as you move up, is subpar, much like at many peer companies. \r\n\r\n- Career growth is best for Brazilians, then males, then Caucasians, with everyone else still able to grow quickly but clearly limited by their minority status...  \r\n\r\n- The company is more focused on cost-cutting (which is a temporary way to improve returns) than innovation (which is the long-term vision needed to improve our viability in the market vs. competitors). Lack of real innovation is pretty standard at such large companies, though.\r\n\r\n- The above mentioned short-term focus manifests because of the very young teams and high turnover -- there's no incentive for the long term, when your bonuses and performance are measured by monthly & quarterly & 1-year goals, and when you leave your current project / team / company in mere months / very few years. \r\n\r\n- The company seems pretty hit or miss. Those who are young, flexible, hungry, and willing to tough it out really come across amazing opportunities and unparalleled career growth vs. anywhere else you can kick start your career. But that's more due to the youth, inexperience, and lack of structure in the company, than it is due to actual development efforts or actual company growth. I would highly recommend any young person to come to KHC, but would not recommend to anyone to stay too long, for two reasons. One, the entire industry and this company too will probably struggle to keep up with changing food trends.

the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the \"Pros\" as I see them...\r\n\r\n- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.\r\n- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.\r\n- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.\r\n- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.\r\n- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.\r\n\r\nGranted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.", "cons": "Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off.

We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.\r\n\r\nBeing able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.", "overall": 5, "overallNumeric": 5}, "ceo": {"name": "Mark Zuckerberg", "title": "CEO", "numberOfRatings": 1820, "pctApprove": 98, "pctDisapprove": 2, "image": {"src": "https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/40772/facebook-mark-zuckerberg.png", "height": 200, "width": 200}}}, {"id": 546, "name": "Progressive Insurance", "website": "www.progressive.com", "isEEP": true, "exactMatch": false, "industry": "Insurance Carriers", "numberOfRatings": 1859, "squareLogo": "https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/546/progressive-insurance-squarelogo-1405549260276.png", "overallRating": "3.6", "ratingDescription": "Satisfied", "cultureAndValuesRating": "3.9", "seniorLeadershipRating": "3.4", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": "3.8", "careerOpportunitiesRating": "3.5", "workLifeBalanceRating": "3.3", "recommendToFriendRating": 67, "sectorId": 10014, "sectorName": "Insurance", "industryId": 200066, "industryName": "Insurance Carriers", "featuredReview": {"attributionURL": "http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Progressive-Insurance-RVW17089352.htm", "id": 17089352, "currentJob": true, "reviewDateTime": "2017-09-29 10:24:17.83", "jobTitle": "Employee", "location": "", "headline": "CLAIMS ADJUSTER", "pros": "The Pay is pretty good", "cons": "Workload is very heavy at times", "overall": 4, "overallNumeric": 4}, "ceo": {"name": "Tricia Griffith", "title": "President and Chief Executive Officer", "numberOfRatings": 261, "pctApprove": 90, "pctDisapprove": 10, "image": {"src": "https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/546/progressive-insurance-ceo1485863162606.png", "height": 200, "width": 200}}}, {"id": 3482, "name": "HSBC Holdings", "website": "www.hsbc.com", "isEEP": false, "exactMatch": false, "industry": "Banks & Credit Unions", "numberOfRatings": 6787, "squareLogo": "https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/3482/hsbc-holdings-squarelogo.png", "overallRating": "3.4", "ratingDescription": "OK", "cultureAndValuesRating": "3.4", "seniorLeadershipRating": "2.9", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": "3.3", "careerOpportunitiesRating": "3.2", "workLifeBalanceRating": "3.5", "recommendToFriendRating": 65, "sectorId": 10010, "sectorName": "Finance", "industryId": 200048, "industryName": "Banks & Credit Unions", "featuredReview": {"attributionURL": "http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-HSBC-Holdings-RVW17151819.htm", "id": 17151819, "currentJob": false, "reviewDateTime": "2017-10-03 15:56:35.097", "jobTitle": "Employee", "location": "", "headline": "Senior Software Engineer", "pros": "you will get a great work recognition", "cons": "As I have given 5 stars there are no cons working with HSBC", "overall": 5, "overallNumeric": 5}, "ceo": {"name": "Stuart T.

Please read to the end!", "pros": "So many pros here....let's start with:\r\n\r\n1) Freedom & flexibility- the ability to be an independent contractor (1099 associate) who can set their own hours, work pace, and income level. \r\n\r\n2) Preparation for the future- It is also nice that you can utilize AIL to gain valuable knowledge about sales, marketing, business development, communications and almost any other valuable skill/trait you would normally acquire in a university/college setting before setting out into the professional world. AIL is a great place for people to develop a solid core for what may lie ahead in their future for what they ultimately want to do for the rest of their lives. \r\n\r\n3) A fully-vested, Union-protected 10-year renewal plan makes achieving whatever you want to do in life possible- whether it is starting your own business or a non-profit, without taking out huge small business loans. Work hard now- enjoy the financial benefits for the rest of your life. \r\n\r\n4) The socialization aspect: from policyholders to co-workers to the random person that opens up the door to you on a daily basis there is never a boring day @ AIL. In short, we get paid to drive, talk, and help educate people on how to be financially literate when it comes to insurance and savings. Also, we get invited to BBQ's, family functions, and many other cool events from our members. It is impossible to work @ AIL and not develop a strong social network as a result of working here!\r\n\r\n5) The opportunity to be given recognition and additional responsibilities based on your own results, instead of on tenure or who you know\r\n\r\n6) Legitimate 6-figure income reality...I've personally only had 1 year under $100,000 and I took a ton of time off that year. I had never made more than 50,000 per year working 60-70 hours per week in retail prior to AIL.\r\n\r\n7) Good Senior Leadership/Mentors: although rare, this company truly some fantastic individuals sitting in high-profile & decision-making positions within the company...many of whom truly live the company's mottos and operating principles to the 'T'\r\n\r\n8) Ability to rebound quickly in a financial crisis- whether it happens directly or indirectly to you there a very few professional opportunities where you can go make an extra 10K or so the following month, even if you are not a manager. While money is the root of all evil, it can also help you do great by and support those around when times get tough. As long as someone focuses on the beneficial aspects of the monetary opportunity at AIL they will be in a good place.\r\n\r\n9) Running your own business- as long as you are showing results and growth, you can run your own office(s) with nearly absolute autonomy. But, unlike running your own traditional business, you have the support of a Fortune 700 company and its senior leaders when you need it. It's the best of both world's really.", "cons": "NOTE: Every individual AIL office is franchised and no two are exactly alike in nature...just like a fast-food chain or multiple-location gym.\r\n\r\nDepending on your SGA (AIL franchise-owner), RGA, MGA, and other upline managers, you may have the above-mentioned freedom & financial opportunities inhibited by several factors including: \r\n\r\n1) Micromanagement- many managers treat their associates like W-2 employees in their daily interactions with them and should be reminded of the 6-Point Test for Independent Contractors to help them develop a working relationship that is more true to the nature of their contract. Recommend to do something, but not require them to do something. Small but huge difference between the two.\r\n\r\n2) Too heavy of a focus on the scripts- teach your associates the script and it's key components but don't hold back their creativity and interpretation of the presentation- remember, you hired them because they were intelligent beings (I hope)...not script-reciting robots.\r\n\r\n3) Mandatory Meetings- yikes, this is a huge legal volcano waiting to bury the SGA's of this company. Recommend attendance and explain why it is important associates are there...and leave it at that.\r\n\r\n4) Lack of accountability from senior management- remember, you are not infallible...quit making promises you can't back up and if you fail to uphold your end of the bargain, make it right in whatever way possible!\r\n\r\n5) Buddy-buddy system- depending on the SGA, many are very cliquey and develop too tight of an inner-circle where the general attitude becomes very akin to a fanatic cult. Stay true to your standards and guidelines, not to who challenges you the least and edifies the very ground you walk on\r\n\r\n6) Chargebacks and selective underwriting- you may actually owe the money back to the company if you submit a policy that does not get issued due to health, even though sometimes the insured met the underwriting guidelines of the field guide you were issued. AIL also does not like to underwrite large policies for some reason.\r\n\r\n7) Too many traps in the bonus system- many times as a senior manager I have not earned the bonuses I projected on earning because of the several pitfalls in the bonus system, such as the quality of the downline manager (the manager you are supervising), the fact that your downline managers did not code enough new associates (even though you might have)\r\n\r\n8) The Peter-principle- associates are promoted to management positions to rapidly in many SGAships across AIL so they never get a chance to fully grow into their previous role and end up failing miserably at everything.

If they offer you blank, say thank you and dive right back into your achievements and prior experience. Sell yourself.\n\nPaychex just moved from an Annual Review process to a quarterly review process or a \u201c4x4\u201d for its employees. Having experienced this new review process it seems excessive and puts unnecessary stress on employees, supervisors, and management when the time could best be utilized on job tasks. Instead of once a year in early August, you have to write about why you\u2019re a good employee 3 more times a year and then your supervisor has to review it and meet with you. Oh and the managers have to review your supervisor three more times a year too and so on and so forth.\n\nGroupthink- More so in recent years, friends that get promoted then promote their friends regardless if you are more qualified. This applies for males and females. In the end, you have a team where the supervisors and management are close outside of work and the actual team can feel isolated or become paranoid that if one person in the management clique of 5 doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re worth your pay then it\u2019s all over.

Would recommend a full replacement of Payroll from top-down and ask some of the contract workers that have multi-company experience for their input. There's more recurring mistakes due to incompetent senior and middle Payroll management and overworked base level staff. I've worked in companies 10 times the size of TIAA that had 10% of the mistakes per employee as TIAA Payroll, and that is being generous.\r\n-Human resources is overwhelmed sometimes, especially when there are larger influxes of new staff due to acquisitions.\r\n-Some of lower and middle management seem to be resistant to changing the way that they operate and have become complacent in their responsibilities to their staff. \r\n-Like many larger organizations, TIAA is slow to implement new technology initiatives. This is not due to the security of the initiatives, it is because many of the teams are protecting the way that they have traditionally followed somewhat antiquated processes. A more expeditious process should be developed and implemented to take things from idea to implementation that doesn't take 6-18 months. Also, consolidation of toolsets that are not redundant and costly would help. IT seems to implement tools/applications and leave the tools that were supposed to be replaced for years after they should be decommissioned.\r\n-Work/Life balance is an issue in some specific roles within certain areas, including some IT and Payroll positions.", "overall": 4, "overallNumeric": 4}, "ceo": {"name": "Roger Ferguson", "title": "President & CEO", "numberOfRatings": 724, "pctApprove": 90, "pctDisapprove": 10, "image": {"src": "https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/2998/tiaa-cref-roger-ferguson.png", "height": 200, "width": 200}}}, {"id": 4021, "name": "American Cancer Society", "website": "www.cancer.org", "isEEP": false, "exactMatch": false, "industry": "Social Assistance", "numberOfRatings": 1135, "squareLogo": "https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/4021/american-cancer-society-squarelogo-1398178683779.png", "overallRating": "2.9", "ratingDescription": "OK", "cultureAndValuesRating": "3.2", "seniorLeadershipRating": "2.4", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": "3.2", "careerOpportunitiesRating": "2.5", "workLifeBalanceRating": "3.0", "recommendToFriendRating": 37, "sectorId": 10018, "sectorName": "Non-Profit", "industryId": 200089, "industryName": "Social Assistance", "featuredReview": {"attributionURL": "http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-American-Cancer-Society-RVW16970233.htm", "id": 16970233, "currentJob": false, "reviewDateTime": "2017-09-22 11:37:38.52", "jobTitle": "Employee", "location": "", "headline": "American Cancer Society Company Review", "pros": "There is a consistent focus on the mission, which is to help people with cancer to get well and stay well; to support research to find cures for cancer; and to advocate for people with cancer to get access to care.

The company is in front of the market and many business's will recruit you as they know people from Gartner are usually among the brightest.  \r\n\r\nThis is a very good company, and they are growing like crazy.  I have had a personal bad experience, but I would have worked for the company and done it all again.  I would just have hoped to get placed on with a senior manager who was proven and a good leader.", "cons": "Huge problem developing people.  Academy is a process that is 2+ months long.  After going through many interviews, flying around the country, and going through 2+ months of training's, you still might not be a good fit.  A lot of people move just for this job, and they do not even know if they will make it through training and a lot of people don't.  \r\n\r\nManagement is a problem, be careful of the bait and switch.  In your interview process you will meet with VP and successful members of management, which is who determines if you get the job.  However, that will more than likely be your last exposure with them, which I did not realize.  When you come out of the Academy, you are going to be at random assigned a manager and a team.  You have no control over the types of people or manager you have to report to.  My experience was awful, I walked into a team that hated their manager.  My mentor was going to quit unless the manager left soon, and 4 of the 7 people on my team left recently because of management issues.  I walked into a less than desirable situation and I could do nothing about it.  \r\n\r\nMany people say people don't quit companies, they quit managers.  This is certainly the case at Gartner.  The turnover is tremendously high, they will downplay this hard, and many of my peers asked the same questions I did, and you will just feel that they are not being honest.  They will want to pitch you and say that it is promotions, don't let them lie to you.  Within my first year every person that sat next to me or on other teams around me had changed.  Out of the 10-15 people close to me that left, 1 was promoted.  They will force a lot of people out, they dont fire, but they put extensive pressure, and it happens a lot.  \r\n\r\nThe problem really is not bad quality candidates or poor training.  It is the lack of management.  The majority of the managers are rookie managers who are not experienced with people development.  Many are under the age of 30, and they simply lack experience of being leaders, they focus solely on being managers and managing numbers.  \r\n\r\nThis is a dial for dollars job. Call Call Call, this is a call center.  No matter how much they try to make it look cool or edgy, you need to be very clear on expectations, because the real job is to consistently cold call.  The territories have been consistently shrinking has they are bringing in more and more sales people.  The list of companies you get to prospect has been contacted many many times, in fact the company is now even switching prospect lists quarterly, so every quarter a new sales rep is reaching out trying to get a sale, which can make for tough cold call sessions and blitz days.  The only way to come over that, is to find new start up companies to target, the challenge there is those companies are seeking funding, and you are asking them to spend more money then what they have in hope we can get them help with funding.\r\n\r\nOn top of switching your prospects, you may have to switch territories often as well.  This is not a job where you have a specific territory and you develop and build relationships with people.  You have to call and try to get the deal right away.  When you do switch prospects or territories you have a few weeks at best to close anything that is already in the works.  The problem is often you will get people to reach out to you months later when they are ready.  Many sales jobs that is ideal as your efforts eventually pay off, but at Gartner, they are no longer your prospect and you do not get any rights at all to get that business, even if they ask for you it is a battle to get the business to fall your way.  \r\n\r\nYou wont have any good tools for CRM or LMS. Tracking prospects or notes is not going to happen, everything is done via personal notes, which your not going to get once they become your prospect.  \r\n\r\nYou must have spirit to work here.  There are so many dress up days and theme days, you must dress up much like high school very regularly to have \"spirit\" weeks.  \r\n\r\nDo not get use to your team, change happens so much.  There are a few sales employees who have tenure, but not very many at all.  In fact many of the people who you will meet with tenure actually had most of that tenure in another role in the company, usually CP, the sales channel does not have that much success keeping people long term.  \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of uncontrollables at this company.  Your manager, your team, your territory, your book of business......all of that is something you have no say or control over.  All of it impacts your income and longevity with the company.\r\n\r\nYou should not talk to upper management.  When you get out of training, I was told by a lot of people on the floor that you should not talk with upper management on issues.  Upper management is great to have fun with and interact with personally, but you should not have business issues discussed with them.  Two times I had issues where I had a specific game plan to obtain a business deal, both these times my direct manager told me not to go with my game plan and go with hers instead.  Both times her game plan did not work.  So when I talked to upper management about the situation he suggested something different, which was the exact plan that I had in the first place, I asked him then how I could better communicate with my manager so we could have avoided this.  That was a mistake on my part as that rocked the boat and made for a uncomfortable situation.  Both of those examples I was able to save the business, and I felt I should absolutely be able to have a strategic conversation with my VP to better communicate with my brand new manager.  But as all of my senior peers advised, don't go to management unless it is a massive huge problem or they ask you in to talk, just don't do it.", "overall": 4, "overallNumeric": 4}, "ceo": {"name": "Gene Hall", "title": "CEO and Director", "numberOfRatings": 984, "pctApprove": 88, "pctDisapprove": 12, "image": {"src": "https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/2465/gartner-gene-hall.png", "height": 200, "width": 200}}}, {"id": 404578, "name": "Adecco USA", "website": "www.adeccousa.com", "isEEP": false, "exactMatch": false, "industry": "Staffing & Outsourcing", "numberOfRatings": 978, "squareLogo": "https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/404578/adecco-usa-squarelogo-1470054621701.png", "overallRating": "3.0", "ratingDescription": "OK", "cultureAndValuesRating": "2.8", "seniorLeadershipRating": "2.6", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": "2.6", "careerOpportunitiesRating": "2.7", "workLifeBalanceRating": "3.0", "recommendToFriendRating": 49, "sectorId": 10006, "sectorName": "Business Services", "industryId": 200032, "industryName": "Staffing & Outsourcing", "featuredReview": {"attributionURL": "http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Adecco-USA-RVW17147746.htm", "id": 17147746, "currentJob": false, "reviewDateTime": "2017-10-03 12:12:07.8", "jobTitle": "Administrative Assistant", "location": "Missoula, MT", "jobTitleFromDb": "Administrative Assistant", "headline": "Very Helpfu", "pros": "Friendly staff.

And it excels at finding leaders who are willing to go the extra mile to be untrustworthy and make you feel like your job isn't safe (and for real, it's not).", "cons": "Let's talk.\r\n\r\nThe company has been growing like crazy, and one thing that was never thought about was \"can we actually hire at a sustainable rate, and scale accordingly?\"  The answer was no on both counts.  Software engineers at Wayfair have a history of disappearing.  People who enter labs have an especially low success rate (70% make it through, and less than 50% last a whole year).  It's basically their way to run people through a burnout gauntlet, and see who survives.  And then you have the stories of the people who come in to work and are just asked to resign.  You'll see hints of it here on Glassdoor if you dig, and it's even worse than what you read.\r\n\r\nThey actually gathered all the engineers for a big meeting at the beginning of this year.  And they said that they were sorry that people felt scared and were sad that people felt like management didn't care.  Which is exactly how we felt.  They promised that their door was open, and they were going to work hard to set things right.  One person out of 500 stood up and asked a really cutting question.  AND THEN THEY FIRED HIM!  And there were 3 completely different official reasons given about it.  It's crazy.\r\n\r\nThe leaders also started up an engineering meeting to keep everyone on the same page and answer anonymous questions.  One time someone asked why we couldn't get snow days off, because it was tough to shovel for 3 to 4 hours and still work an 8 hour day.  So the leaders proceeded to talk down to us and reprimand us for even thinking about asking a question like this.\r\n\r\nTurnover has been high over the past year, and the best people are leaving.  This worries management, but they still have no idea that the problem is actually them creating a terrible environment.\r\n\r\nSo if you're a good person who cares about the person next to you and leaving things better than you found them, don't bother applying here.  But if you're not, and you just want to keep your head down and not question anything, then this is the perfect place for you.  And if that's what you want, Wayfair gets 5 stars.  \r\n\r\nAmazing career opportunities if you want to have the same job forever.  \r\nIncredible senior management that value untrustworthiness.  \r\nA fantastic culture of watching people next to you disappear.  \r\n\r\nIt's truly a perfect company.", "overall": 5, "overallNumeric": 5}, "ceo": {"name": "Niraj Shah", "title": "CEO", "numberOfRatings": 600, "pctApprove": 77, "pctDisapprove": 23, "image": {"src": "https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/134525/wayfair-niraj-shah.png", "height": 200, "width": 200}}}, {"id": 139064, "name": "Mosaic Sales Solutions", "website": "www.mosaic.com", "isEEP": false, "exactMatch": false, "industry": "Advertising & Marketing", "numberOfRatings": 1114, "squareLogo": "https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/139064/mosaic-squarelogo.png", "overallRating": "3.6", "ratingDescription": "Satisfied", "cultureAndValuesRating": "3.5", "seniorLeadershipRating": "3.2", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": "3.4", "careerOpportunitiesRating": "3.1", "workLifeBalanceRating": "3.4", "recommendToFriendRating": 73, "sectorId": 10006, "sectorName": "Business Services", "industryId": 200022, "industryName": "Advertising & Marketing", "featuredReview": {"attributionURL": "http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Mosaic-Sales-Solutions-RVW17093602.htm", "id": 17093602, "currentJob": true, "reviewDateTime": "2017-09-29 14:58:06.14", "jobTitle": "Employee", "location": "", "headline": "Brand Ambassador", "pros": "Great company to  work for!!", "cons": "Don't have any cons about Mosaic.", "overall": 5, "overallNumeric": 5}, "ceo": {"name": "Jeff Rogers & Brian Kava", "title": "President Experiential Marketing & President Retail Marketing Services", "numberOfRatings": 238, "pctApprove": 82, "pctDisapprove": 18, "image": {"src": "https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/139064/mosaic-sales-solutions-jeff-rogers-and-brian-kava.png", "height": 200, "width": 200}}}, {"id": 7691, "name": "Holiday Retirement", "website": "www.holidaytouch.com", "isEEP": false, "exactMatch": false, "industry": "Real Estate", "numberOfRatings": 916, "squareLogo": "https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/7691/holiday-retirement-squarelogo-1373039421681.png", "overallRating": "2.2", "ratingDescription": "Dissatisfied", "cultureAndValuesRating": "2.1", "seniorLeadershipRating": "1.9", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": "2.6", "careerOpportunitiesRating": "2.2", "workLifeBalanceRating": "1.9", "recommendToFriendRating": 24, "sectorId": 10020, "sectorName": "Real Estate", "industryId": 200094, "industryName": "Real Estate", "featuredReview": {"attributionURL": "http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Holiday-Retirement-RVW17106527.htm", "id": 17106527, "currentJob": true, "reviewDateTime": "2017-09-30 22:02:03.12", "jobTitle": "Prep Cook", "location": "Yucaipa, CA", "jobTitleFromDb": "Prep Cook", "headline": "Great place to work.

I remember being so excited about working in their beautiful corporate office\u2014only to find that I\u2019d be working in this other location. From the outside, it\u2019s nothing special\u2014but from the moment I walked in the door, I found it refreshing in a way I had never felt before. It\u2019s so bright and uplifting (the lighting, the temperature, the walls, the ceiling, the carpet, the unique coffee machine, the cubes (though lacking on some ways\u2014overall, they were fantastic with their frosted glass and all). \r\n\r\nThere are just so many positive things I could say about that place\u2014and \u201calmost\u201d all the people I worked with.\r\n\r\nI would add that the extra hours were ramp-up time for me on MDX, so that extra time was not for billable hours (and rightly so). It was a wonderful opportunity for me to do some work I\u2019ve been dying to get into for years, and I was willing to do whatever it took to deliver.\r\n\r\nOnce I got into a rhythm, I had the process down pretty well\u2014so I had found my groove. I love those times when you\u2019re under the gun and there\u2019s so much to overcome in order to fulfill your responsibilities. It had been a long time since I felt like that, and it should have been smooth sailing from that point on.\r\n\r\nBut bad apples and inept managers have a knack for ruining a good thing.\r\n\r\nIt never ceases to amaze me that companies will fret over money while flagrantly wasting it. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve created a song-and-dance culture where \u201cpresentation\u201d is paramount\u2014where company handbooks espouse what is glaringly absent in practice. Where you can put up a \u201cwall of words\u201d for company credos\u2014while an undercurrent of systemic nonsense flows along with ease.\r\n\r\nIt takes a special kind of stupidity to put up with people who poison possibility\u2014and then condemn the dedicated who actually live up to every word on that wall, but have the nerve to call it like it is. \r\n\r\nI did everything I could to keep my mouth shut\u2014letting my manager persist in his folly, because I just came here to keep my head down and diligently do my job. That someone was brazenly impeding progress on one report\u2014in the past I never would have let that go. But if they wanna be idiotic about how they run their business\u2014and pay somebody with bad attitude (the running joke, the resident clown, the company mascot\u2014every company inexplicably employs these people), then have at it. \r\n\r\nThis time, I was done trying to explain the fundamentals of leadership to people who are seemingly oblivious to their bedrock responsibilities. That a manager would openly gripe about the person in question\u2014fumbling around while trying to solve the symptoms of a problem (instead of picking up the phone for 5 minutes with the other person\u2019s manager\u2014to deal with the source)\u2014is preposterous.\r\n\r\nHow could the most obvious possible solution utterly escape someone in charge?\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the problem is that most managers in IT are not real leaders\u2014they\u2019re typically technical people who want to move up and need to get promoted somehow. They want the money, the power, and the prestige, but they don\u2019t really want the responsibility that comes with the job. They are usually fixated on a getting another feather in their cap, and anything that interferes with them keeping up appearances must be eliminated. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a reason why I find out so much information so early on in my contracts\u2014because I\u2019m paying attention and listening to those who have something to say. And why do you think those colleagues confide in me? It\u2019s because the manager is flagrantly failing them. These so-called leaders talk out of both sides of their mouth\u2014putting on a show about how their \u201cdoor is always open\u201d\u2014never mind how wildly out of whack they are from reality.\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re not real managers\u2014they\u2019re glorified administrators who play a part. Time after time it all comes back to the \u201cpresentation\u201d\u2014while simultaneously shirking their inherent responsibilities.\r\n\r\nAs I put in a letter to the CEO: \r\n\r\n*************************************\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a given that there\u2019s a degree of finesse that\u2019s required when dealing with personalities and resistance, but when that effort becomes excessive\u2014at some point it\u2019s an HR/managerial matter. I wrote the following many years ago: \u201cWhat confounds me is why companies coddle people who epitomize the lowest common denominator. Rather than inspire them to rise to standards set by others, the meticulous are asked to accommodate the careless. Moreover, there seems to be a universal rolodex of excuses that gets spun to absolve those in question.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n*************************************\r\n\r\nAnd what you think this CEO was concerned about in response to my letter? \r\n\r\nThat a contractor didn\u2019t go through the \u201cproper\u201d channels to communicate his concerns.\r\n\r\nAnd THAT is the BS of \u201cThe American Way\u2014to deflect, evade, blame\u2014whatever it takes so long as you don\u2019t have to accept responsibility for anything. Anything goes in a culture of \u201cI claim, therefore I am.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd what of that \u201cCulture of Can Do\u201d\u2014all that stuff about accountability, ownership, integrity, results, trust, acting as one, growth, listening, and bias for action.\r\n\r\nSure looks good on a wall, doesn\u2019t it!\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least\u2014I love how all these stand-ups act as a way to disguise the obvious. There\u2019s nothing wrong with stand-ups\u2014I just take issue with putting up stickies while the glaringly obvious goes unaddressed.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not doing your job!\u201d\u2014how\u2019s that for a sticky?\r\n\r\nI love Bill Belichick\u2019s outlook on teamwork: \u201cThe main point to me is that [the players] have to be coordinated, and the 10 people have to support what that 11th guy is doing, and vice versa. . . . The only way that can happen is for there to be discipline, for everyone to be disciplined enough to do their job, knowing the guy beside him is doing his, too, so that you can count on him and he can count on you, and go right down the line.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt all goes back to fundamentals and it always will. I don\u2019t care if you make billions for a company\u2014if you don\u2019t deliver on your inherent responsibilities, you\u2019re still a failure in my eyes.\r\n\r\nRichard W.

Why would they give me work when everyone who works here as been in the HDD industry for decades and can do everything faster/better than a new hire?\r\n\r\nThe pay is not amazing, but I've gotten a lot of promotions and salary increases in the couple years I've worked here. I have a lot of friends who work significantly harder than me at other companies who don't get any recognition. WD recognizes hard work.\r\n\r\nHard drives are endlessly interesting. They are a mature product and there isn't a ton of research/hands on stuff going on, but you could easily spend your whole life learning about a hard drive. It's endlessly complicated and requires skills from every engineering discipline.\r\n\r\nThe Sandisk merger has kept WD healthy and the stock has been going up. WD's stock is very volatile, but that's a good thing with the ESPP since you get locked in to the lowest price the stock hits in each 6 month payout period over 2 years. So the stock plummetted to $35 a while back, but that's actually a good thing because now I'm selling at $90. Volatility is great for ESPP", "cons": "Everyone seems to be close to retirement age.

They then publically display your call stats and rank you amongst your peers. The turnover rate is very high as people soon realize that they did not just spend an astronomical amount of money on school to work at an outbound call center collecting real estate data. It's literally a revolving door at CoStar. Don't expect to be able to transfer your skills unless you are looking at other call center opportunities. Also, the salaries for a Research Associate are a flat rate. There is zero room for negotion. So if you have a Masters and work experience, you make just as much as a fresh college grad with zero experience. It is definitely a degrading feeling to know that they do not value your education or experience.

Other departments are similar but may not be exactly the same.\r\n\r\n1. Great culture. The people are really cool. The work environment is laid back but when work is demanded, everyone cooperates and gets down to business.\r\n2. The company is fairly young from a business standpoint, so you can really leave an impact. There is a lot of work that needs to and can be done.\r\n3. Small company vibe without being too corporate.\r\n4. A bunch of small but great benefits: Several hundred dollars a year where you can spend on any recreational activity or equipment, generous food discount, great PTO and flexibility (work/life balance is encouraged and very important to them), the office is nice and modern, free covered parking.", "cons": "1. To a lot of people, some benefits aren't great (no 401k match (yet) and health insurance is on the expensive side) but I am young and single and really don't care for them. Management is optimistic about providing better benefits once the company grows and makes more profits, however.\r\n2. It is a fairly young and small company from an organization standpoint so not every policy and procedure is in place yet. If you can't deal with ambiguity then this will be a con for you.\r\n3. The IT department has been through a lot of changes in the past year including reorganizations. Everyone currently has good intentions but things can be questionable at times.

I even heard of a donation made to help those affected by the storm.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the company was been working diligently preparing for what Irma might bring.  Communicating continuously and engaging with Associates throughout the company to make arrangements so that the company both keeps running and looks after the safety and well being of associates.   Moving folks to safety, providing food and lodging.  There are more stories than I can recount about genuine caring for each other.  I was amazed to see how amidst plans the company was able to mix both looking for those on vacation and honeymoons while releasing a large, feature rich code release.  \r\n\r\nIn short, Benefitfocus is an amazing place with amazing people and culture.", "cons": "I can't think of any at this time.", "overall": 5, "overallNumeric": 5}, "ceo": {"name": "Shawn A.
