Most engineers I know work on fixing defects and bugs for 80 - 90% of their work time, this is necessary for delivering quality products, however, for the remaining of their time, engineers work on features that customers may never need/ask. Many features are just plain dumb and the reason why they are created is because the product owners can't keep his people idling while getting paid.\r\n\r\nthe legacy code smells and feels like a bucket of dynamite - if you change something without knowing the big picture, the entire system may crash -- boom!!!\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, engineers are not encouraged to be innovative and they are **told** what defects/features they should work on from each sprint. The only opportunity I see as innovative is the hackathon that happens only ONCE a year. Compared to other companies I know, Facebook has 6- 8 hackathons a year! \r\n\r\nMSTR should encourage its engineers to think out of the box, the product owners have no idea what makes a great software. \r\n\r\nFavoritism is another problem I see on a daily basis, if the PO favors someone, s/he will give that person a fat bonus, which is quite unfair to those who keep their heads down and working hard.\r\n\r\nI see no clear career path within the company either.", "overall": 3, "overallNumeric": 3}, "ceo": {"name": "Michael J.

They are risk averse when it comes to marketing innovation, yet they pride themselves on being innovative. Too much empahsis on driving bookings vs. long term thinking about brand building. Leadership lacks vision and creativity and has a myopic view on driving revenue in the short term. They are innovative in many ways, but conservative in general.

Consultant", "location": "Atlanta, GA", "jobTitleFromDb": "Implementation Consultant", "headline": "Great Culture and Product", "pros": "I had left a few years ago, but working at FAST was still my best experience in any work environment. I fully attribute this to the PM at the project and my team lead. They were exceptional: caring, intelligent, and great problem solvers. The company does care about the employees - it's very clear. The work itself may not always be extremely challenging, but I was never bored at work. The people that are promoted to a lead role deserve it and are hard workers.\r\n\r\nIn response to the reviews mentioning that the skills don't translate over from this job to another: From someone who has left and gone to other jobs, if you're looking for a specific software or class to teach you a skillset, no you won't be learning 'transferable' skills. However, you are still learning VB.NET, SQL, and client-facing exposure. You are also learning implementation cycles as well as good coding practices. New hires that look at FAST software and say it's not good... It is worse in many places; it's the best I've worked with...  Look past the 'proprietary' software and understand the usage of it. Fast's version control is excellent.

I used to think that a job could only be but so good -- that it could only satisfy two of the three major requirements (pay, people and project). My husband says that he learned in business school that you will, in fact, only ever get two of the three. However, I have found all three at Glassdoor. A great salary, funny/hard-working people and a project or work product that challenges me every day and gives me the autonomy I've been looking for.\r\n\r\nIt's a senior start-up, as I like to say. Glassdoor has the nimbleness of a start-up with none of the uncertainty. It has the professional polish of a large company without the politics or bureaucracy. It's a great place for those who know what they want and have the drive, passion and mid-career experience to make it happen.", "cons": "As a member of the marketing organization, I don't experience many of the downsides that others might.

To do everything we want to do, we'll have to either focus on the 80-20 rule more, or hire more people.\r\n\r\n-Location. I love working on the waterfront, but the commute is hard for 85% of the company in Mill Valley. A larger SF office with opportunities to work from there would be great not only for current staff but for our recruitment and retention efforts.\r\n\r\n-People of Color. No need to beat around the bush, I'm not talking about \"diversity.\" I'm referring to actual people of color in our ranks. We need more. We have diversity of thought, gender, socio-economic status, etc. However, Glassdoor truly struggles with hiring and retaining people of color.

Unlimited PTO. I enjoyed my time here and feel it was a great place to have on the resume.", "cons": "Upward mobility for women is desperately lacking. They were just voted a great place to work for women. Why?  Because of a generous maternity policy, I would assume.  They didn't even mention women in their write-up about it which is exactly appropriate for the situation. The ranking is smoke and mirrors. There are no women in the C suite and the smartest VP's leave for the C suite elsewhere. There are lots of men who think they are really smart, and most of them are, but the smartest leaders are the ones who admit and act upon diverse solutions. \r\nThere are women on the service teams and a few other departments who are promoted and very few \"friends of the family\" who they know they can control. Women in sales who have moved up recently had another layer placed over their head. They are now pretty much at the same level they were but with even less power because of the additional male-dominated team put above them. Talk about a rock and a hard place. \r\n\r\nTech teams are untouchable even when a client has valid issues. This creates unbelievable expectations on the sales team to keep the client happy, with no power, while your quota and livelihood is tied to this insanity.\r\n\r\nEverything operates in a shroud of mystery. They intentionally keep departments away from each other and their favorite word to a client need is \"no\". Be prepared for more NO than you have ever experienced before. It took me 4 months to figure out pricing because there is no pricing. It is \"what can you get out of your customers\" which is why I think this shroud exists and quite frankly, working.\r\n\r\nBonus plans are paid instead of commissions.  In the beginning, this seems cool, until you realize that for the amount of product you are selling, it is very subpar to industry standards, you can't help but realize you are being bilked.  Especially when there were bonus bumps after ample service but they seem to have been done away with that with recent management changes. Last note on bonus over the commission structures that most salespeople are accustom to. Commissions are protected by law, bonus payouts are not.  This means that as soon as you sell something on commission, you are owed that commission by law.  Bonus is never required to be paid out, they will use this to their advantage and not yours.\r\n\r\nBase Pay: good when you 1st evaluate it.  Once you get in you realize they are paying less experienced, worse performers, more. My assessment is because they are male. You are \"forbidden to discuss pay rates\", though by law, you are allowed to and it is illegal for them to tell you that you can fire you for it.  Look it up! They can be heavily fined for this practice if someone decides to go after them.  Hello Lilly Ledbetter!\r\n\r\nUnlimited PTO:  Again this looks great on the surface. Who wouldn't want that!?! It is actually a catch 22.  It is very enticing until you want to use it. When I put in for less PTO than I had taken the year before unlimited PTO change, I was chastised for abusing the policy. It all comes down to your manager.  Additionally, if you accrue PTO, when you leave, they have to pay that out to you.  They do not with an unlimited plan.\r\n\r\nGoal setting: An unspoken mystery of how they produce your goal for the quarter.  Supposedly with \"algorithms\" and other voodoo magic. The rumor is the finance team does it- like they have any clue what your clients will be up to that quarter. Then it is handed to the sale managers where they have the liberty to adjust the number to each member of their team. (I'm not sure even they know how the initial numbers are produced. ) Soooo the top performers are almost always getting exceedingly high expectations because they work themselves to death to hit them and the not so top performers barely grow their territories. At the end of the quarter, both top, and not so top, are paid almost the same bonus with a few percentage point changes to make it less obvious... It's awesome... yeah right.  \r\nSales industry norms are that teams hit quota 65-75% of the time. Anything more is too easy, anything less, too hard. At Indeed, if you don't hit quota 100% of the time, you risk going \"on plan\". Another recent development since management change this past year. They use this form of punishment arbitrarily.  If they like you and you keep hitting 90-95% of your goal, your cool.  No worries.  If they don't like you and you hit 95-99%, you could be in trouble or made to feel unwanted. Which as salespeople know is usually the same end result. Recently, a manager really liked their employee but senior management decided it was their time to go.  He intruded on the relationship until the employee had no choice but to leave. Good times!\r\n\r\nWork/life balance: If you let it, Indeed will work you to death. If you don't care as much and everyone really likes you, you can live it up fairly cush and just keep hanging. I worked so hard, and everyone really liked me, and I really liked them, but I just couldn't do another year of it. They pushed me until I broke, because I cared, exceeded my goals, and was the positive life of the party.  Unfortunately, as soon as you start to feel less taken care of by your employer than you are taking care of them, it's hard to get back from burnt.", "overall": 4, "overallNumeric": 4}, "ceo": {"name": "Hisayuki Idekoba", "title": "CEO", "numberOfRatings": 309, "pctApprove": 86, "pctDisapprove": 14, "image": {"src": "https://media.glassdoor.com/people/sqll/100561/indeed-hisayuki-idekoba.png", "height": 200, "width": 200}}}, {"id": 1004830, "name": "Caleres", "website": "jobs.caleres.com", "isEEP": true, "exactMatch": false, "industry": "Department, Clothing, & Shoe Stores", "numberOfRatings": 443, "squareLogo": "https://media.glassdoor.com/sqll/1004830/caleres-squarelogo-1434467751938.png", "overallRating": "3.4", "ratingDescription": "OK", "cultureAndValuesRating": "3.4", "seniorLeadershipRating": "3.1", "compensationAndBenefitsRating": "3.4", "careerOpportunitiesRating": "3.1", "workLifeBalanceRating": "3.2", "recommendToFriendRating": 60, "sectorId": 10022, "sectorName": "Retail", "industryId": 200105, "industryName": "Department, Clothing, & Shoe Stores", "featuredReview": {"attributionURL": "http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Caleres-RVW17047622.htm", "id": 17047622, "currentJob": true, "reviewDateTime": "2017-09-27 07:59:04.383", "jobTitle": "Director", "location": "Saint Louis, MO", "jobTitleFromDb": "Director", "headline": "Many Career Opportunities with a Winning Company", "pros": "Outstanding leaders; opportunity to grow your career across multiple businesses within one portfolio company including retail and wholesale; entrepreneurial spirit where creativity and results are recognized and rewarded.

But I must admit, on this occasion I felt very compelled and wanted to take a moment and share with everyone who reads this review, how awesome it is to work for an employer who truly does care and values the well-being, safety, and success of its employees. That employer I speak of is Ultimate Medical Academy Online in Tampa Florida.  As you all must know from recent news, that the area of Tampa Bay experienced a serious and dangerous hurricane in the past week, that being Hurricane Irma.  During this time of preparation prior and after the storm\u2019s passing, Ultimate Medical Academy went above and beyond in being as accommodating as you would want any company to be by not only providing several support services, but also allowing us to take the necessary time outside of the work place to be with our loved ones and do what was necessary in order to prepare for this Monster storm\u2019s arrival.  \r\n\r\nAfter several days of recover from the storm\u2019s aftermath, it was time to return to work.  Upon return, Ultimate Medical Academy provided us all with a pretty amazing lunch spread, not only for our first day back, but we were informed that we would have lunch provided for the remainder of the week!  Pretty awesome stuff don\u2019t you think?  Wait, it gets better!!  Aside from the lunch that was provided for us, we were also informed that we were all being compensated for the regularly scheduled time that we had missed due to the storm.  Yes, that is correct!  No hours needed to be taken from our PTO time.  Ultimate Medical Academy was compensating us as if we had worked those scheduled hours even though we were not physically at work, working. What company does that?!  And for several days mind you!   I have never worked for a company who not only values our success and growth as professionals, but also values our well-being, our family\u2019s well-being, and our safety.  For those of you who are new to the company, feel grateful and appreciate that you work for a pretty awesome organization.  For those of you who are still questioning whether you should apply for possible consideration to be a part of our organization?  Well, if this review doesn\u2019t help you decide, then I wish you best of luck in finding a better place to continue your career.  I would like to take this opportunity to say \u201cthank you\u201d to Ultimate Medical Academy for being so accommodating and being that \u201cUltimate\u201d employer!", "cons": "Nothing in this world is perfect.

You work with people of all nationalities in multiple locations.   And because of that, you gain a wide perspective that informs  your daily work and decisions.  Elsevier is at a stage in its storied history where it is moving far beyond it's publishing heritage.  Advances in data science and machine learning now make it possible to extract intelligence and insight from Elsevier's trove of data and highly structured information.  Certainly every big company today is becoming a \"big-data company\" but in Elsevier's case, there is a potential  to advance science and health and contribute an extraordinary impact.   The people at Elsevier around the world are well-educated, engaged, dedicated, and care deeply about what they do.  You rarely come across anybody just punching the clock here.      It's exciting to be a part of this.", "cons": "Elsevier has a long history and with that comes a fantastic foundation of content, data, and operational expertise; but it also comes with baggage. legacy systems, legacy policies, and bureaucracy are the norm for well-established companies and Elsevier is no different in that regard.   But when you make that breakthrough, or cross that milestone at Elsevier, it's all the more satisfying to see the difference you are making , and the difference that the company can make.   It's tougher to make a career for employees outside our corporate centers.  The onus is on you to build you network (often virtual) and gain visibility.   Elsevier demands a great deal of its employees. International collaboration also comes with crazy work hours.  Those who are strong at self-managing themselves will do well here.

Access to proprietary sales interaction data--anonymized--and then a way to monetize that data by using it to help other customers sell more?  It may be the greatest business model ever.\r\n\r\nSecond best is the people, but this hasn't consistently been true.  The people at InsideSales today are True Believers, and they are working hard to make the vision for the company come true.\r\n\r\nI appreciate a startup culture.  In a startup, there isn't time for politics, and the only thing that matters is results.  InsideSales felt that way in the early days, then forgot it was a startup and hired bureaucrats and corporate survivors.  These hiring mis-steps almost cost InsideSales its birthright, and the startup soul of the company was nearly sucked out.\r\n\r\nBut...  the bureaucrats and cynics are gone, the startup culture is back, and things are up and to the right again.\r\n\r\nNo startup is without its drama or existential risk.  InsideSales has both, and it is an invigorating place to work!", "cons": "InsideSales still has a couple of cultural hangovers.  One is a \"blame culture,\" which might stem from the bad experience of having too many bureaucrats and corporate survivors in management.  But we need to continue to squash that.  Good people are doing their best to fight battles every day, and we need to support them in their successes and failures.\r\n\r\nThe other thing we don't have right yet is a true focus on customer success.  This is especially true of the product organization.  Product is becoming more customer empathetic, but they aren't there yet.  It can still be the case that engineers or PMs cite internal considerations as reasons not to do the right thing for the customer.  Or worse yet, not bother to find out what the customer needs.
